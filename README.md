# Million-User Matching Platform (Tinder-like System)

## Functional Requirements:

- [ ] **Matching Engine:** Matches users based on preferences (age, location, interests) using **Elasticsearch** for fast retrieval.
- [ ] **Real-time Messaging:** Enables real-time messaging via WebSockets, with messages stored in **Cassandra**.
- [ ] **Swipe Mechanics:** Implements swipe functionality, caching data in **Redis** for fast processing.
- [ ] **Geolocation-based Matching:** Filters users by proximity using GPS data to offer location-based matches.
- [ ] **Push Notifications:** Sends notifications for new matches and messages through **Kafka**.
- [ ] **SMS Notifications:** Sends notifications via SMS for broader user reach.
- [ ] **User Authentication:** Secure JWT-based authentication for access control and user data protection.
- [ ] **AI-based Matching:** Uses machine learning to enhance match suggestions based on behavioral patterns.

## Non-functional Requirements:

- [ ] **Scalability:** Designed to support millions of concurrent users with horizontal scaling via **Kubernetes**.
- [x] **Low Latency:** Real-time user interactions (swipes, chats) with minimal delay through optimized caching in **Redis**.
- [ ] **Reliability:** Message queueing and retry mechanisms via **Kafka** ensure reliable notification delivery.
- [ ] **Fault Tolerance:** Fault-tolerant microservices architecture, with automatic failover and retries.
- [ ] **High Availability:** Ensures zero downtime with **Kubernetes**-based orchestration and rolling updates.
- [ ] **Security:** End-to-end encryption and JWT for securing communication and user data.
- [ ] **Data Consistency:** Guarantees data consistency in distributed environments using **Cassandra** for messaging and **Elasticsearch** for user matching.
