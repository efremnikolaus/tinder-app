# Million-User Matching Platform (Tinder-like System)

> This system is designed to efficiently match and connect millions of users in real-time, providing seamless user experience even at large scale.

## Functional Requirements:

- [ ] **Matching Engine:** Matches users based on preferences (age, location, interests) using **Elasticsearch** for fast retrieval.
- [ ] **Real-time Messaging:** Enables real-time messaging via WebSockets, with messages stored in **Cassandra**.
- [ ] **Swipe Mechanics:** Implements swipe functionality, caching data in **Redis** for fast processing.
- [ ] **Geolocation-based Matching:** Filters users by proximity using GPS data to offer location-based matches.
- [ ] **Push Notifications:** Sends notifications for new matches and messages through **Kafka**.
- [ ] **SMS Notifications:** Sends notifications via SMS for broader user reach.
- [ ] **User Authentication:** Secure JWT-based authentication for access control and user data protection.
- [ ] **AI-based Matching:** Uses machine learning to enhance match suggestions based on behavioral patterns.

## Non-functional Requirements:

- [ ] **Scalability:** Designed to support millions of concurrent users with horizontal scaling via **Kubernetes**.
- [ ] **Low Latency:** Real-time user interactions (swipes, chats) with minimal delay through optimized caching in **Redis**.
- [ ] **Reliability:** Message queueing and retry mechanisms via **Kafka** ensure reliable notification delivery.
- [ ] **Fault Tolerance:** Fault-tolerant microservices architecture, with automatic failover and retries.
- [ ] **High Availability:** Ensures zero downtime with **Kubernetes**-based orchestration and rolling updates.
- [ ] **Security:** End-to-end encryption and JWT for securing communication and user data.
- [ ] **Data Consistency:** Guarantees data consistency in distributed environments using **Cassandra** for messaging and **Elasticsearch** for user matching.

## Additional Features:

- **Profile Update Guarantee:** When updating a user profile with an email address that already exists in the system, the existing user's information will be updated with the new details. (If a user is registered multiple times, the latest profile update will overwrite any previous entries.)

### Scalability / Low Latency

The system is designed to efficiently handle millions of concurrent users, ensuring low-latency operations and real-time interactions. To achieve scalability and low latency, the system utilizes the following strategies:

- **Request Partitioning:** When a user action (such as swipe, message, or match request) occurs, the system dynamically determines the number of instances currently running using a **Service Discovery** mechanism like **Eureka**. Based on the instance count, user-related data (e.g., swipes or matches) is partitioned and processed in parallel by multiple instances, using **Kafka** for distribution and load balancing.
  
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple service instances enable the parallel processing of user actions. This improves the overall system performance, reducing delays for real-time interactions (like swiping or messaging).
  
- **Result Aggregation:** After processing user actions, results (such as match statuses or message deliveries) are aggregated and passed to a separate microservice responsible for delivering notifications or updating user profiles. This modular architecture supports both high throughput and scalability.

### Reliability

To ensure high reliability, the system includes the following components:

- **Sender Service:** When delivering notifications or processing actions (e.g., swipes or messages), if an error occurs, the service marks the task as "RESENDING." This allows for reprocessing and ensures data consistency.
  
- **Rebalancer Service:** Periodically checks for failed or incomplete actions marked as "RESENDING." It then retries these tasks to ensure that no user actions are lost or left incomplete.
  
- **Kafka Integration:** Messages or tasks marked for "RESENDING" are transmitted back to **Kafka**, which distributes them to the appropriate microservices for reprocessing. This ensures reliable message delivery and fault tolerance.

### Security

The system uses secure communication and access control mechanisms to protect user data and ensure authorized access:

1. The client initiates a request (e.g., swipe or login) via the **API Gateway** with a **JWT token** in the request header.
2. The **API Gateway** extracts and validates the JWT token by interacting with the **Security Service**.
3. Upon validation, the **Security Service** returns the client ID to the API Gateway.
4. The **API Gateway** includes the client ID in the request headers and forwards the request to the relevant microservice (e.g., Swipe, Match, Chat).
5. The target microservice uses the client ID to authenticate and process the request, ensuring secure communication and data handling.

## Additional Components

- **Monitoring and Logging:** All microservices are integrated with monitoring tools (e.g., **Prometheus** or **Grafana**) and centralized logging systems (e.g., **ELK Stack**) to provide insights into system health and performance. This supports real-time issue detection and quick remediation.
- **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming user requests across service instances to ensure even load distribution and prevent server overloads.

This architecture is built to support millions of concurrent users, ensuring low latency, reliability, and security at scale.
